#### Key Features
- **Operating System**: Runs a variety of Linux-based operating systems, with Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) being the most popular.
- **Processor**: Equipped with ARM-based processors. The latest models feature quad-core or even octa-core processors.
- **Memory**: Varies from 512MB to 8GB of RAM, depending on the model.
- **Storage**: Uses microSD cards for storage, providing flexibility in storage capacity.
- **Connectivity**: Includes USB ports, HDMI, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins for hardware interfacing.
- **Peripherals**: Supports a wide range of peripherals like keyboards, mice, cameras, and more through USB and other interfaces.

#### Use Cases
- **Education**: Ideal for teaching programming, computer science, and electronics.
- **Prototyping**: Used by makers and hobbyists to develop and test IoT applications, robots, home automation systems, etc.
- **Media Center**: Can be turned into a media center using software like Kodi.
- **Server**: Capable of running as a web server, file server, or even a lightweight cloud server.

#### Popular Models
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: The latest model, with options for 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB RAM.
- **Raspberry Pi Zero**: A smaller, more affordable variant ideal for lightweight applications.

## Arduino

#### Overview
- **Arduino** is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's designed for anyone making interactive projects. Unlike the Raspberry Pi, which is a full-fledged computer, Arduino is a microcontroller, focused on interfacing with sensors and actuators.

#### Key Features
- **Microcontroller**: Uses various microcontrollers, with the ATmega328P being one of the most common (as found in the Arduino Uno).
- **Programming**: Programmed using the Arduino IDE, which is user-friendly and based on a simplified version of C/C++.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Features multiple digital and analog I/O pins for connecting sensors, actuators, LEDs, motors, and other components.
- **Connectivity**: Different boards support various connectivity options, including USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet.
- **Power**: Can be powered via USB, batteries, or external power supplies, making it flexible for embedded applications.

#### Use Cases
- **Prototyping**: Widely used for prototyping electronic devices and systems, especially where interaction with the physical world is required.
- **Education**: Great for learning the basics of electronics, programming, and hardware interfacing.
- **Embedded Systems**: Used in applications such as automation, robotics, wearable devices, and more.
- **DIY Projects**: Perfect for hobbyists creating custom electronics projects.

#### Popular Models
- **Arduino Uno**: The most popular model, ideal for beginners.
- **Arduino Mega**: Offers more I/O pins and memory, suitable for more complex projects.
- **Arduino Nano**: A compact version of the Uno, suitable for space-constrained applications.
