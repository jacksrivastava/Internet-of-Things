# Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network of spatially distributed, autonomous sensors that monitor physical or environmental conditions and communicate the collected data to a central location. WSNs are used in various applications such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, industrial automation, and smart cities.

## Key Components of WSN

1. **Sensor Nodes**: 
   - Each node is equipped with a sensor to detect environmental conditions, a microcontroller for data processing, a communication module for data transmission, and a power source, typically a battery.
   
2. **Sink Node (Gateway)**:
   - This node collects data from sensor nodes and forwards it to a central server or cloud for further processing and analysis.
   
3. **Communication Infrastructure**:
   - This includes the protocols and hardware used for data transmission between sensor nodes and the sink node, which can be wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LoRa) or wired.

4. **Power Supply**:
   - Typically battery-powered, but can also use energy harvesting methods such as solar power to extend the network's lifetime.

5. **Central Server/Cloud**:
   - Receives and processes data from the sink node, providing insights, analytics, and user interfaces.
